### Note: A very, very faint partial halo CME seen West COR2A and (even fainter) (North) East in SOHO LASCO C2/C3. Overlapping with the the later, 2022-07-03T04:12Z, CME after a couple timestamps in COR2A. A possible source could be a very slow, faint but very large-area post-eruptive arcades on the southern side of the large CH at disk center on 2022-07-02. These post-eruptive arcades close out more than half of this coronal hole over the course of 2022-07-03, so it is probably associated with a very slow large and central filament eruption.

#### Note: This analysis is very uncertain because the CME is extremely faint, especially in SOHO LASCO coronagraphs (a super faint front can be traced in multiple timestamps in C2 but in C3 it is almost indistinguishable), also the CME overlaps with a faster narrower CME in Stereo A COR2. This analysis should be taken with a grain of salt.

### Active Region Number: 13047
### [Link](https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/20714/-1)
### Note: This partial halo CME is very faint but can be seen to the SW in SOHO LASCO C2/C3 and STEREO A COR2 coronagraphs. The source is likely the eruption from AR 3047 seen best in SDO AIA 171 and 304 at 2022-07-05T04:01Z. This eruption is also visible in the SW quadrant of STEREO A EUVI 195 and 304 imagery.

### Note: This CME is visible in the W/NW of SOHO LASCO C2/C3 and STEREO A COR2 coronagraphs. The source is likely back-sided as there are no clear source signatures on the Earth-facing disk. However, around 2022-07-05T05:30Z post eruptive loops may form beyond the NW limb as seen in SDO AIA 171 imagery. It is possible this originates from the same eruption which was responsible for this CME.

### Note: An eruption associated with the long-duration M2.5-class solar flare which occurred near N20E40. The CME presents itself as a faint halo in SOHO/C3 imagery and possibly a halo in Stereo-A/COR2A imagery with a bulk component mostly to the east in all available coronagraph imagery. The eruption as seen in coronal imagery is relatively unimpressive with mostly bright post-eruptive arcades and an EUV wave that traverses north and west of the source region best seen in SDO AIA 211 imagery.

### Active Region Number: 13053
### [Link](https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/20787/-1)
### Note: A complicated eruption consisting of a generally unimpressive flare/subsequent eruption in coronal imagery located around center-disk (N15E10) from AR3053. A fast jet of plasma is seen sharply deflecting towards the northwest due to the present of multiple coronal holes surrounding the active region, but SOHO/C2 coronagraph imagery shows what could be a faint, wider bulk associated with this eruption generally toward the northwest and an even fainter partial halo emanating generally to the west. It is uncertain whether the halo or bulk is associated with this center-disk eruption or another simultaneous eruption occurring off the Sun's western limb; moving field lines seen in SDO AIA 171 indicate this possibility. A Stereo-A COR2A outage at the time complicates the analysis of this event.

### Note: Full halo CME visible mainly to the southwest in SOHO LASCO C2, C3 and STEREO A COR2 imagery. This halo overlaps another halo that is more towards the northeast in SOHO LASCO C2, C3, and STEREO A COR2 imagery. The source of this CME is not visible due to the backsided nature of the event. There is some uncertainty with this event due to multiple CMEs occurring during the time of this event.

### Note: This halo CME is visible mainly to the north/northeast in SOHO LASCO C2, C3 and more towards the north/northwest in STEREO A COR2 imagery. The front of this CME is relatively faint compared to the other CMEs occurring around the same time. The source of this CME is unclear due to the backsided nature of the event. Due to the multiple CMEs at the time of this event, the analysis of this event was difficult and may have some uncertainty with the parameters.

There are multiple CMEs at the time of this event making for a tricky analysis process. Uncertainty may be higher than normal with this event. The measured speed of this CME ranges from roughly 900 km/s to 1800 km/s. The wide range of speeds is due to a portion of the leading edge of the CME seen towards the northeast in SOHO LASCO C2, C3, and STEREO A COR2 moving faster in later frames.

### Note: This CME is seen faintly to the SW in SOHO LASCO C2, C3 and more clearly to the SW in STEREO A COR2 imagery. The potential source of this CME is a minor eruption to the south of AR13059 that is associated with filament material. The exact start time of this CME was difficult to delineate due to the overlapping of multiple CMEs.

### Note: This CME is associated with a large filament eruption seen clearly in SDO/AIA 304 and 171. The filament is seen beyond the limb to the SW and is believed to be backsided. There is associated field line movement visible in SDO/AIA 171. Bright H-alpha emission is visible with the filament as it propagates outward in the SOHO LASCO C2, C3 and STEREO A COR2 fields of view. This CME overlaps with multiple other CMEs seen in the coronagraphs.

#### Note: These parameters are based off of the fit around the filament feature since the edges of the CME are not clearly visible in the coronagraphs due to overlap with multiple CMEs. Therefore, this CME may be wider and slightly slower. StereoCAT measurements suggest speeds closer to 650-700 km/s.

### Note: This CME is visible to the northeast in STEREO A COR2 imagery and to the north/northeast in SOHO LASCO C2 imagery. It is faintly visible in SOHO LASCO C3 difference imagery for a frame or two, but not enough to use for analysis. The source of this CME appears to be a filament eruption beyond the eastern limb of STEREO A EUVI data as seen in one frame of STEREO A EUVI 304 at 2022-07-23T20:15Z. There is a large data gap in STEREO A data that impacted the analysis of this CME, especially when locating the source location.

A portion of the CME was left out of this measurement to gain a better fit. The portion was seen to the left of the CME and moved with the main filament structure, but did not appear fully connected. It was harder to track in the imagery, therefore it was excluded. Updated parameters may be provided when STEREO A Science Data becomes available.

### Note: Faint CME NW in SOHO LASCO C2/C3. Its front is not seen in COR2A b/c of the large data gap in STEREO A imagery. A probable source could be a minor eruption in the NW seen in SDO AIA 193 after 2022-07-27T03:30Z as an area of dimming (~N40W52) with the rising loops to the South of it (~N30W52). However, there is also a filament eruption seen close to the NW limb in SDO AIA 304 around 2022-07-27T05:30Z, also seen as moving field lines on the NW limb in SDO AIA 171/193.

### Note: This CME is visible as a partial halo in STEREO A COR2 and SOHO LASCO C2/C3 moving primarily southeast. The source is likely far-sided as there are no clear source signatures on the Earth or STEREO A facing disk. However, there is an eruption or possible post eruptive signature visible in STEREO A EUVI 304 imagery at 2022-07-30T-2:15Z beyond the eastern limb. There is also a data gap in STEREO A EUVI 195 imagery from 2022-07-29T21:05Z to 2022-07-30T02:55Z but when imagery appears it is clear there was an opening of field lines/ noticeable change in field line structure visible to the E/SE which is the direction this CME is headed. It is possible the main eruption occurred during this data gap and only the post eruptive signatures are detectable.

### Source Location: N15E95
### Active Region Number: None
### [Link](https://kauai.ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/DONKI/view/CME/21067/-1)
### Note: This CME is visible to the E/NE in SOHO LASCO C2/C3 and STEREO A COR2 coronagraphs. The source is a  filament lift-off just beyond the NE limb (near N15E95) seen in SDO AIA 304 at 2022-07-31T22:40Z. An opening of field lines is visible in this same region around 23:00Z in SDO AIA 171 and 193. There is a data gap in STEREO A during the eruption but once imagery reappears around 2022-08-01T01:25Z there is a clear reconfiguration/ opening of field lines off the NE limb. Finally, this CME is associated with a C9.3 flare originating from just beyond the NW limb.
